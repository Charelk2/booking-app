# Notifications API and Card Usage

`NotificationCard` displays a single alert in the drawer or full screen modal.
The frontend converts API responses using `getNotificationDisplayProps` which
maps each notification to `NotificationCard` props. Message notifications are
created whenever a new chat message is sent. The card subtitle includes a short
snippet of the latest message so clients can quickly decide whether they need to
open the conversation.

Notification WebSocket connections send periodic `ping` heartbeats. The
frontend now replies with `pong` and ignores these control messages so they do
not appear in the drawer. All notification timestamps are formatted for the
South African time zone (GMT+2).

SMS alerts and other external deliveries are now dispatched through an
in-process background worker. Each send operation is retried up to three times
with exponential backoff; failures are appended to a dead-letter queue for
future inspection.

Important fields returned by `/api/v1/notifications`:

- **sender_name** – name or business name of the actor that triggered the
  notification. When not stored, the backend derives it from related booking
  requests or bookings. `getNotificationDisplayProps` also falls back to parsing
  the sender name from message strings like `"New message from Bob: Hi"` when
  this field is missing.
- **link** – relative path to navigate to when the card is clicked. The UI uses
  `router.push(link)` so paths must be valid client routes.
- **avatar_url** – optional profile picture for the relevant artist or client.
  When absent, the UI displays a default placeholder image so booking
  confirmations and deposit reminders still show an avatar.

Clicking a card marks the notification read then navigates to `link`. The card
shows a coloured icon based on the status, the sender name as the title and a
short subtitle derived from the notification type.

For message notifications the `link` points directly to
`/inbox?requestId={id}`, opening the Inbox with that conversation active.
This lets users jump from the notification drawer straight to the chat thread
without any intermediate redirect.

Artists sending a quote or declining a booking request now generate a new
message notification for the client. These alerts also link to
`/inbox?requestId={id}` so clients can immediately view the conversation where
the action occurred.

For quote notifications, the backend derives the artist and client from the
associated booking request, so the alert is delivered even if the quote payload
omits or mislabels those IDs.
