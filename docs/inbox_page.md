# Inbox Page Overview

Clients and artists communicate through the dedicated **Inbox** page. The layout is split into three sections:

1. **Conversation list** on the left displays all booking requests sorted by the most recent update. Unread threads show a red dot indicator.
2. **Chat area** in the center shows all messages for the selected request. Quotes appear as special bubbles with **Accept** and **Decline** buttons for clients.
3. **Booking details panel** on the right summarises key information from the request and, when a quote is accepted, provides quick links to pay the deposit and add the event to a calendar.

Notifications for new messages link directly to the relevant conversation in the Inbox. When the artist sends a final quote the client can open it here, accept it and proceed with payment without leaving the page.
