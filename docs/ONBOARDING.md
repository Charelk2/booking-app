# Onboarding Guide

This guide walks new users through securing their accounts with two-factor authentication (2FA).

1. **Register and log in.** Once logged in, visit `/security` to manage 2FA settings.
2. **Enable 2FA.** Start the setup process, scan the generated QR code in your authenticator app, then verify the code. Recovery codes will be displayedâ€”store them somewhere safe.
3. **Disable 2FA.** If you lose access to your authenticator, use a recovery code to disable 2FA at `/security/disable`.

Enabling MFA greatly reduces the risk of unauthorized access. Keep your recovery codes secure and regenerate them periodically.
