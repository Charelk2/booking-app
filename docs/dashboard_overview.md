# Dashboard Overview

The redesigned dashboard organizes key information in cards and highlights what needs attention.

- **Profile progress bar** – displays how complete your artist profile is. Uploading media, adding services and filling out your bio all increase the percentage.
- **Quick actions** – primary tasks such as adding a service, requesting reviews, boosting a service, viewing quotes, or accessing provider and quote calculator resources are presented as buttons right below the progress bar.
- **Bookings list** – shows upcoming confirmed bookings with a link to view them all.
- **Requests list** – summarizes recent booking requests and links to the full requests page.
- **Service cards** – drag and drop services to reorder how they appear to clients.
