# Booking App

This repository contains a FastAPI backend and a Next.js frontend.

The June 2025 update bumps key dependencies:

- **FastAPI** 0.115.12 (requires Starlette 0.46+)
- **Uvicorn** 0.34
- **React** 18.3 and **Next.js** 14.2

For a map of all booking agents, see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).


## Docker Setup

Pull the pre-built image or build it yourself, then run the development
servers inside a container:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/example-org/booking-app-ci:latest # optional pre-built image
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/example-org/booking-app-ci:latest
```

To develop using the pre-built image without reinstalling dependencies, mount the repository and expose the ports:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/app -p 3000:3000 -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/example-org/booking-app-ci:latest
```

If you prefer to build locally instead, run:

```bash
docker build -t booking-app:latest .
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -p 8000:8000 booking-app:latest
```
The Dockerfile installs Node.js via the official NodeSource setup script
so that `npm ci` runs reliably during the build.

### docker-test.sh quickstart

1. **Populate caches with network access**

   ```bash
   DOCKER_TEST_NETWORK=bridge ./scripts/docker-test.sh
   ```

This pulls (or builds) the testing image and copies `backend/venv` and
`frontend/node_modules` from the container. If only the `*.tar.zst` archives
exist, the script extracts them so the directories are restored. This first
run is mandatory&mdash;`./scripts/test-all.sh` will fail until these caches
are populated.

If `DOCKER_TEST_NETWORK` isn't set and the caches are missing, the script
now automatically uses `--network bridge` and prints a notice so the
dependencies can be fetched.

2. **Run tests offline**

   ```bash
   BOOKING_APP_SKIP_PULL=1 DOCKER_TEST_NETWORK=none ./scripts/docker-test.sh
   ```

   Subsequent runs reuse the cached dependencies and pass `--network none` to
   avoid downloading packages, making the tests start much faster. Rebuild the
   image or delete the caches whenever `requirements.txt` or `package-lock.json`
   changes so the updated packages are installed.

The container installs all Python and Node dependencies. During the build
step it creates `backend/venv` and installs the requirements into that
virtual environment. A marker file `backend/venv/.install_complete` is also
added after a successful install along with a hash of `requirements.txt`
stored in `backend/venv/.req_hash`. `setup.sh` checks these files so
repeated runs skip `pip install` when nothing changed. Node dependencies live in `frontend/node_modules` with a corresponding hash stored in `frontend/node_modules/.pkg_hash`. Use a volume mount to iterate locally:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/app -p 3000:3000 -p 8000:8000 booking-app:latest
```

## Backend

Run the API from the `backend` directory so Python can find the `app` package:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The SQLite database path is automatically resolved to the project root, so you can start the backend from either the repo root or the `backend/` folder without creating duplicate database files.

### Service type enum

`services.service_type` stores enum string values such as `"Live Performance"`. If you run into lookup errors, ensure your SQLAlchemy model uses:

```python
SQLAlchemyEnum(ServiceType, values_callable=lambda e: [v.value for v in e])
```

### CORS configuration

Allowed origins are read from `.env` under `CORS_ORIGINS`. By default it includes:

```env
CORS_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:3000","http://localhost:3002"]
```

You can supply a JSON array or a comma-separated string. To test from another device on your LAN, add its origin, for example:

```env
CORS_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:3000","http://localhost:3002","http://192.168.3.203:3000"]
```

Then start the API on all interfaces:

```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Unhandled exceptions are returned as JSON 500 responses, so your configured CORS headers are always included.

---

## Frontend

The frontend lives in `frontend/`. From that directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev              # listens on localhost only
npm run dev -- -H 0.0.0.0  # listens on all interfaces
```

By default it calls `http://localhost:8000`. To point elsewhere, create `frontend/.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://192.168.3.203:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://192.168.3.203:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyDm-BKmMtzMSMd-XUdfapjEUU6O5mYy2bk
```

The location input relies on the built-in Google Maps Places Autocomplete
service instead of the experimental `@googlemaps/places` package. The previous
dependency caused a build failure because it depended on Node-only modules like
`fs`. No additional npm install step is required after this change.

To expose the app on your local network, replace `192.168.3.203` with your
machine's LAN IP. Set the same address in `backend/.env` under
`CORS_ORIGINS=["http://<your-ip>:3000"]`, then start the backend with
`--host 0.0.0.0` and run `npm run dev -- -H 0.0.0.0` so both servers listen on
all interfaces.

The frontend automatically attaches an `Authorization` header when a token
exists in the browser's `localStorage`. The request interceptor now verifies
`typeof window !== 'undefined'` before accessing `localStorage`, so server-side
rendering and tests that lack a `window` object no longer fail.
`useIsMobile` also initializes to `false` and updates on mount so mobile devices
avoid hydration errors when rendering responsive components.

---

## Development

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for a reference to the automation modules that may require updates when adding features.

### One-time setup

Install **both** Python and Node dependencies. The `setup.sh` script can be run
from any directory and automatically installs backend and frontend packages:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This script installs Python requirements from `backend/requirements.txt` **and**
`requirements-dev.txt`, then runs `npm ci` inside `frontend/` using `pushd`/`popd` so your working directory is restored afterward.

### Linting

```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
```

### Testing

Before using the regular test runner, populate the dependency caches by running

```bash
DOCKER_TEST_NETWORK=bridge ./scripts/docker-test.sh
```

This command copies `backend/venv` and `frontend/node_modules` from the Docker
image. Running `./scripts/test-all.sh` alone will fail if these directories do
not exist because `setup.sh` cannot install packages offline.

```bash
./scripts/test-all.sh
```
This script runs `pytest`, executes Jest using Node, and finally
`npm run lint`. Running the CLIs directly avoids missing binary errors when
`node_modules/.bin` links are not created. `setup.sh` skips dependency
installation when packages are already present so repeated test runs are much
faster. The test script now verifies that `node` and `npm` are available,
logs their versions, prints the full path and version of the Jest binary, and
exits with a helpful message if the binary is missing (for example, when
`npm ci` was interrupted).
The script drops a marker file `frontend/node_modules/.install_complete` after a
successful `npm ci` so subsequent runs skip reinstalling dependencies unless
that file is removed. After installing Python requirements, `setup.sh` creates
`backend/venv/.install_complete` so it can skip `pip install` on future runs.
Each cache also stores a SHA256 hash of its lock file
(`backend/venv/.req_hash` for `requirements.txt` and
`frontend/node_modules/.pkg_hash` for `package-lock.json`). `setup.sh` compares
these hashes to the current files and reinstalls the dependencies only when the
hashes differ.

`setup.sh` now verifies that both `pip install` and `npm ci` succeed before any
marker files are created. If either step fails, the script prints an error and
suggests running `./scripts/docker-test.sh` with network access to fetch the
required packages. The marker files (`.install_complete`, `.req_hash`, and
`.pkg_hash`) are written only after successful installs so failed downloads do
not pollute the cache.

If the virtual environment cache (`backend/venv/.install_complete`) is missing
and no internet connection is available, `setup.sh` aborts before running
`pip install` and prints:

```
‚ùå Dependencies missing and network unavailable.
Run ./scripts/docker-test.sh with DOCKER_TEST_NETWORK=bridge to fetch packages.
```

**Important:** run `./setup.sh` or `./scripts/docker-test.sh` once with network
access so these marker files are created. Subsequent offline runs reuse the
cached `backend/venv` and `frontend/node_modules` directories. When using
`docker-test.sh` for the first time, allow network access (for example by
setting `DOCKER_TEST_NETWORK=bridge`) so the script can copy the cached
dependencies from the image. After they exist, export
`BOOKING_APP_SKIP_PULL=1` and pass `--network none` to keep the environment
offline while reusing the caches.
It also detects which files changed in Git and only runs
the backend or frontend tests when necessary; documentation-only changes and
commits with no code updates cause the script to exit immediately without
running any tests. Set `FORCE_TESTS=1` to run the full suite regardless of
what changed.

You can override the number of parallel Jest workers by setting the
`JEST_WORKERS` environment variable. `test-all.sh` passes this value to
`npm test` using Jest's `--maxWorkers` flag, so you can control concurrency:

```bash
JEST_WORKERS=75% ./scripts/test-all.sh
```

You can also run the tests inside the Docker image if you prefer not to install
anything locally:

```bash
docker build -t booking-app:latest .
docker run --rm booking-app:latest ./scripts/test-all.sh
```

If your CI environment has no external network access, build the image ahead of
time with connectivity so all dependencies are cached. The `setup.sh` script
skips downloads when packages are already present, so repeat runs are fast even
when network access is blocked. You can then run the tests offline:

```bash
docker run --rm --network none booking-app:latest ./scripts/test-all.sh
```

### Playwright E2E Tests

The end-to-end tests live under `frontend/e2e` and run against a production
build of the Next.js app. A lightweight stub server and request interceptors
simulate all backend and external APIs so the tests work offline. Execute them
with:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

### Offline Testing with Docker

If `setup.sh` cannot install dependencies (for example in an isolated CI
environment), build or pull the Docker image once with network access so the
cached dependencies are copied into your repository.

1. **Populate caches with connectivity**

```bash
DOCKER_TEST_NETWORK=bridge BOOKING_APP_BUILD=1 ./scripts/docker-test.sh
```

This command builds (or pulls) the image and copies `backend/venv` and
`frontend/node_modules` from the container. After it finishes you should have
`backend/venv/.install_complete` and
`frontend/node_modules/.install_complete` in your working tree. It also
archives these directories using `tar --use-compress-program=zstd` into
`backend/venv.tar.zst` and `frontend/node_modules.tar.zst` so they can be
restored later without Docker.

2. **Run tests offline**

```bash
BOOKING_APP_SKIP_PULL=1 DOCKER_TEST_NETWORK=none ./scripts/docker-test.sh
```

The script detects the marker files and skips all installation steps. Set
`BOOKING_APP_IMAGE` to override the tag or `BOOKING_APP_BUILD=1` to build the
image when it is not found locally. The script automatically falls back to
`./scripts/test-all.sh` when Docker is unavailable.

The `.req_hash` and `.pkg_hash` files are copied along with the caches so the
setup script can detect when lock files change.

When run with `DOCKER_TEST_NETWORK=none`, the script now checks that the
dependency caches already contain `.install_complete` markers before launching
the container. If either cache is missing, it prints a warning like
`‚ùå Cached dependencies missing` and exits, advising you to rerun with
`DOCKER_TEST_NETWORK=bridge` so the dependencies can be copied over. Once the
caches are in place, future runs with `--network none` complete quickly because
the cached directories are reused.
If `DOCKER_TEST_NETWORK` isn't set and these markers are absent, `docker-test.sh`
automatically uses `bridge` and prints a notice so the caches are populated
without failing.

If `setup.sh` still tries to run `pip install` or `npm ci`, it means the marker
files were not copied correctly. Rerun `scripts/docker-test.sh` with
`DOCKER_TEST_NETWORK=bridge` so the setup step can download the dependencies
and recreate the caches. When the caches are missing but the `.tar.zst` archives
exist, `docker-test.sh` extracts them automatically before running tests so the
marker files are preserved.

Each run of `docker-test.sh` also updates these archives if the directories
exist. Subsequent offline runs look for `backend/venv.tar.zst` and
`frontend/node_modules.tar.zst`; if the directories are missing but the archives
are present, the script unpacks them with `tar --use-compress-program=unzstd -xf`
before calling `setup.sh`.

If you update `requirements.txt` or `package-lock.json`, run
`BOOKING_APP_BUILD=1 ./scripts/docker-test.sh` (or rebuild the image manually)
so the caches include the new packages. The script stores the hashes in
`.req_hash` and `.pkg_hash` and automatically reinstalls when those hashes no
longer match the current lock files.

### Dependency Caching

To speed up CI builds and local Docker runs, reuse package caches between
invocations whenever possible.

- **Node**: share `~/.npm` or `~/.cache/yarn` across runs. When calling `npm ci`,
  add `--prefer-offline --no-audit --progress=false` to minimize network access
  and log noise. In Dockerfiles, copy `package*.json` into their own layer and
  run `npm ci` so cached layers are reused until the lock file changes.
- **Python**: set `pip`'s cache directory via `--cache-dir=/pipcache` and consider
  pointing to a local wheelhouse or mirror. Installing `requirements.txt` in its
  own Docker layer lets subsequent builds skip downloads when the file is
  unchanged.
- **Images**: build a ‚Äúfat‚Äù base image that already contains `node_modules/` and
  the Python virtual environment. CI can pull this image and run tests without
  reinstalling dependencies each time.

### Build

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

## Docker CI

```bash
# Build once (with network)
docker build -t booking-app:ci .

# Run all tests offline (unit & e2e, Chrome/Firefox/WebKit)
docker run --rm --network none booking-app:ci
```

Logs now include `--- STARTING setup.sh ---` and `--- STARTING test-all.sh ---`.

## New Features

### Sound Providers & Quick Quotes

* **Endpoints** under `/api/v1/sound-providers` and `/api/v1/quotes/calculate`.
* Frontend pages: `/sound-providers`, `/quote-calculator`.
* Quote API factors travel distance, provider fees, and accommodation.

### Booking Wizard

* Reusable, centered progress bar and `useBookingForm` hook.
* ‚ÄúBook Now‚Äù buttons on service cards.
* New **Review** step showing cost breakdown and selections.
* Success toasts when saving a draft or submitting a request.
* Simplified buttons sit below each step in a responsive button group.
* Collapsible sections for date/time and notes keep steps short on phones.
* Mobile devices use native date and time pickers for faster input.
* Each step appears in a white card with rounded corners and a subtle shadow.
* The progress bar sticks below the header so progress is always visible while scrolling.
* Venue picker uses a bottom-sheet on small screens to avoid keyboard overlap.
  The sheet now traps focus for accessibility and closes when you press
  `Escape` or tap outside.
* Input fields no longer auto-focus on mobile so the on-screen keyboard stays hidden until tapped.
* Summary sidebar collapses into a `<details>` section on phones so you can hide the order overview.
* Steps now animate with **framer-motion** and the progress dots stay clickable for all completed steps.

### Open Tasks

- Review cross-browser support for the new collapsible summary sidebar and consider a custom toggle for non-standard browsers.

### Real-time Chat

* WebSocket-powered updates.
* Polished bubbles with timestamps, avatars, image previews.
* Consecutive messages from the same sender now group together, showing the
  relative time only below the last bubble.
* 1-on-1 threads show the participant avatar and name only in the header for a cleaner look.
* Fixed input bar & auto-scroll on mobile.
* Desktop bubbles expand wider to avoid unnecessary line breaks.
* Floating ‚Äúscroll to latest‚Äù button on small screens.
* Personalized Video flow: multi-step prompts, typing indicators, progress bar.
* Sticky input demo at `/demo/sticky-input` shows local message appending.

### Notifications

* Persisted via `/api/v1/notifications` & `/api/v1/notifications/message-threads`.
* Bell icon in header; slide-out drawer on mobile.
* Clipboard icon opens `/booking-requests` with an unread badge.
* Unified feed combines booking updates and message threads.
* Mark-as-read endpoints and ‚ÄúMark All as Read‚Äù.
* "Unread Only" toggle filters message threads and alerts in the drawer and full-screen modal.
* Optional SMS alerts when `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` are set in the backend environment.
* Personalized video flows suppress chat alerts until all prompts are answered. A single notification is sent with the booking type once complete.
* System-generated booking details messages do not create extra chat alerts; a single booking request notification is sent after the form is submitted.
* Notification drawer cards use a two-line layout with subtle shadows and collapse/expand previews. Titles are limited to 36 characters and subtitles to 30 so long names don't wrap.
* Booking request notifications display the sender name as the title and the service type in the subtitle with contextual icons. Service names are converted from `PascalCase` or `snake_case` and truncated for readability.

### Artist Profile Enhancements

* ARIA roles, clearer empty states, optional subtitle/tagline.
* Shared `Card`, `Tag`, `TextInput` components.
* Open Graph meta tags and fallback avatars.
* Accessibility and animation improvements.
* Dashboard stats now animate on load using **framer-motion**.

### Service Management (Artist Dashboard)

* Edit, delete, and reorder services by long‚Äëpressing the handle in the top-right corner and dragging the card. Text selection is disabled for smoother reordering.
* Drag handle now reliably activates on mobile by disabling default touch actions, capturing the pointer, and persisting the event during the long press until pointer up or cancel.
* Each service card uses its own drag controller so the correct card moves even after reordering. A subtle ring highlight shows which card is active while dragging, and it disappears when the card is dropped.
* A short vibration cues the start of reordering on devices that support it, using a persisted pointer event for reliability.
* The handle blocks the context menu so long presses don't select text, applying `user-select: none` only during drag so you can still highlight service details normally.
* Reordering keeps the first card below the **Your Services** heading by constraining drag movement to the list area.
* Service deletion now requires confirmation to prevent mistakes.
* **Add Service** button now opens a modal to create a new service. It appears after your services list on mobile and below stats on larger screens.
* "Total Services" card now links to `/services?artist=<your_id>` so you only see your listings.
* Mobile-friendly dashboard cards for bookings and requests with larger service action buttons.
* "Your Services" now appears in a collapsible section just like booking requests, keeping the dashboard tidy.
* Removed the unused "Recent Activity" block.
* Booking request and booking lists collapse after five items with a **Show All** toggle.
* Improved dashboard stats layout with monthly earnings card.
* Streamlined mobile dashboard with collapsible overview and sticky tabs.

## Troubleshooting & Common Errors

* **jest: not found**: Run `npm test` in `frontend/` (auto-installs via `pretest`).
* **Missing package.json**: Ensure you‚Äôre in `frontend/` before running `npm test` or `npm run lint`.
* **next: not found / ENOTEMPTY**: Reinstall in `frontend/` with `npm install` or `./setup.sh`.
* **Module not found: Can't resolve 'framer-motion'**: Run `npm install` in `frontend/` to pull the latest dependencies.
* **Packages missing after setup**: If you see errors like `next: command not found` or `cannot find module`, `npm ci` likely did not finish. Rerun `./setup.sh` or run `npm ci` inside `frontend/`. When offline, use `scripts/docker-test.sh` to restore dependencies.
* **npm ci fails with `ECONNRESET`**: Check your proxy configuration. Run
  `npm config set proxy http://proxy:8080` and
  `npm config set https-proxy http://proxy:8080` if your environment requires a
  proxy. Without these settings you may see `ENETUNREACH` or other network
  errors when running `setup.sh` or `npm ci`.
* **npm install failed**: `scripts/test-all.sh` prints the last npm debug log on
  failure. Verify network access or run `scripts/docker-test.sh` to install
  dependencies offline.
* Running `./scripts/test-all.sh` (or `./setup.sh` first) installs dependencies and
  prints the path to the Jest binary if it is missing.
* Use `scripts/docker-test.sh` when you need to run the tests completely offline
  with cached dependencies.

## Local Test Instructions

1. **Backend tests** (repo root):

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

2. **Frontend lint**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npx eslint src
   ```

### Brand Colors

The frontend uses a small **brand** palette defined in `tailwind.config.js`. The
primary hue is purple (`#7c3aed`), with `brand-dark` and `brand-light` variants.
Components reference these via utility classes such as `bg-brand` and
`bg-brand-dark`.

Update these colors in `frontend/tailwind.config.js` and
`frontend/src/app/globals.css` to adjust the site's look and feel. The Tailwind
config also scans `src/styles/**/*` so constants like `buttonVariants.ts` are
included in the final build. See `frontend/README.md` for detailed theming
instructions.
